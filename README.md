This application's main goal is to allow users to remeber certain information or events. They can either write it down as a note or tasks which allows them to add a date and time for a reminder. There is also an option to pin important information to the home screen so it is the main focus, once logged in.

To build and the application, run these commands to build all versions
first install dotnet 8.0.1, then run the following:
dotnet workload install maui
dotnet restore
dotnet build --no-restore
